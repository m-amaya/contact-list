# React Contact List Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create two contact lists. The first list should just be a directory of all the contacts provided through fetchContacts(). The second list should be a list of a user's favorited contacts. Each contact item should contain a button that will allow the user to favorite or unfavorite that contact. You may use and modify the existing ContactList and ContactItem components to complete this challenge. Please do not focus your time on making the lists look nice, just focus on getting the logic to work.

\*Important, please sort the contacts in the main directory list based on the criteria specified in the comment within the ContactList component. The favorite list does not have to be sorted.
